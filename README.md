Overview
In this phase of the project, the role of Fleet Manager for Az National Trucking (ANT), a fictitious
national trucking corporation based in California, is assumed. The primary responsibility entails
ensuring compliance among all fleet drivers with the corporation's regulations, thereby mitigating
insurance risks associated with factors such as speeding, unsafe following, lane departure, and other
hazardous driving practices. The pertinent details regarding the company's profile and contextual
scenario are outlined below.
Company Overview
Established a decade ago, ANT comprises 400 employees, predominantly long-distance truck drivers.
The core operation of ANT involves offering long-haul trucking services for various general and nonspecialized cargo types, excluding hazardous materials (HAZMAT), across the western United States.

Compliance Guidelines: ANT adheres to compliance and risk management practices as dictated by
the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulations for the trucking industry,
meeting or surpassing the minimum requirements specified in relevant sections. Additionally,
compliance extends to the Department of Transportation regulations and pertinent state-specific
laws and regulations. ANT retains the prerogative to impose more stringent rules concerning certain
risk factors, as warranted by telematics data or business exigencies, within the bounds of legal
permissibility.
Risk Thresholds
Risk mitigation thresholds are established based on regulatory mandates, business imperatives, and
telematics data observations. The organization's current risk factors encompass various parameters,

including but not limited to:
• Mileage
• Speed
• State highway law compliance
• Number of trailers towed
• Freight weight (tonnage)
• Driver logs
• Cargo limitations
• Off-hours operations
• Drug test results
• Driving records
• Telematics sensor violations
• Road closures and rerouting
• Vehicle maintenance and inspection
• Driver qualifications
Truck Driver Risk Factor Cases:
In this phase, the "Mileage/Speed" risk factor threshold is employed to assess individual drivers' risk
levels. A risk factor exceeding or equaling 7.0 (on a scale of 10) triggers an alert or system notification
to ANT corporate management and insurance providers. The risk factor for each driver is calculated
by dividing the total miles by the risk factor, as detailed in the provided Geolocation Excel file.
